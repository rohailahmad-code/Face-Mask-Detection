# Face Mask Detection

## Project Overview

Face Mask Detection is a computer vision-based deep learning project that aims to automatically identify whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time. It can be applied in public places like airports, malls, offices, or educational institutions to ensure health compliance, especially during pandemics such as COVID-19.

## Features

- Real-time mask detection using webcam or CCTV feeds
- Distinguishes between **Mask** and **No Mask** faces
- Bounding box with color-coded labels for clarity
- High accuracy and performance with optimized model
- Easy-to-use interface with minimal setup

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from [Kaggle - Face Mask Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection).  
It contains images with annotated bounding boxes for people wearing masks, not wearing masks, and wearing masks incorrectly.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pretrained deep learning models
